Contributing
============

Contributions are very welcome. 

To contribute any changes, a pull request is necessary. Also, we require 
a review of the code.

All of this can be easily achieved by forking the project on GitHub and opening
a pull request.

There are some naming conventions for branches:

``fix/*``
    Fixes a bug or an open issue.

``feature/*``
    Adds a feature.

``feature/docs/*``
    Adds some documentation.


Contributing to the Documentation
---------------------------------

Contributions to the documentation are very welcome. Indeed, if you have
a question about using the code, consider adding the answer to the docs. 

The documentation uses ``sphinx``. A part of the documentation is written in
the docstring. This documentation is also available from inside python. Other
parts of the documentation are written as restructured text files separate from
the python sources.

Information that is useful for users of the library should be in the
docstrings. Documentation such as installation instructions or tutorials should
be in the separate restructured text docs.

Both parts are compiled together to form the online documentation.
