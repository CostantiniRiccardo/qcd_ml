Installation
============


The easiest way to install ``qcd_ml`` is by cloning the repository
and installing the package using ``pip``::

    git clone https://github.com/daknuett/qcd_ml
    cd qcd_ml 
    pip install .

This will install all dependencies (mostly ``numpy`` and ``pytorch``)
automatically.

If you need a specific version of ``numpy`` or ``pytorch``, install them manually
before installing ``qcd_ml``.
