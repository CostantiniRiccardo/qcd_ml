"""
This module provides neural networks for lattice QCD. 
The modules ``ptc`` and ``lptc`` provide parallel transport pooling and local parallel transport pooling, respectively.
The module ``pt_pool`` provides the ``v_ProjectLayer`` class for parallel transport pooling and some utility functions for 
paralell transport pooling.
